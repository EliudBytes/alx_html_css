## Project Description

The "Smiles School" project aims to create a responsive and visually appealing landing page based on a provided Figma design. The core challenge lies in implementing the design using only native HTML and CSS, without relying on frameworks like Bootstrap or icon libraries like Font Awesome. This project demonstrates proficiency in semantic HTML, CSS layouts (Flexbox, Grid), and responsive design principles.
